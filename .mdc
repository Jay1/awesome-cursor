- README.md is auto-generated. Do not edit manually.
- To update README.md, run: node scripts/update-readme.js
- After pulling from upstream, always run the update script to regenerate README.md.
- Any changes in instructions/, prompts/, or chatmodes/ require regenerating README.md.
- Manual edits to README.md will be overwritten.
- This rule must be enforced on every upstream pull and before any commit affecting documentation tables.
