# README Auto-Generation, Upstream Pull Protection, and No Legacy Meta Files

KEYWORDS: README, auto-generated, upstream, pull, protect, regenerate, script, instructions, prompts, chatmodes, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, LICENSE, SECURITY.md, SUPPORT.md, update-readme.js, delete, Cursor

- README.md is auto-generated. Do not edit manually.
- To update README.md, run: node scripts/update-readme.js
- Only scripts/update-readme.js is authoritative. If update-readme.js appears at the root after an upstream pull or merge, it must be deleted immediately.
- After pulling from upstream, always run the update script to regenerate README.md.
- Any changes in instructions/, prompts/, or chatmodes/ require regenerating README.md.
- Manual edits to README.md will be overwritten.
- This rule must be enforced on every upstream pull and before any commit affecting documentation tables.

## No Legacy Meta Files

- The following files must NOT exist in this repository: CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, LICENSE, SECURITY.md, SUPPORT.md, update-readme.js
- If any of these files are reintroduced by an upstream pull or merge, they must be deleted immediately.
- This rule must be enforced after every upstream update or merge.
- Document this policy in project onboarding and maintenance documentation.

## Code Review and Contribution Requirements

When performing a code review:

- Validate that there are changes in the `README.md` file that match the changes in the pull request. If there are no changes, or if the changes do not match, then the pull request is not ready to be merged.
- Ensure that the values in the front matter are wrapped in single quotes.
- Ensure that the `description` field in the front matter is not empty.
- For `.instructions.md` files, ensure there is an `applyTo` property in the front matter that specifies the file or files to which the instructions apply.
